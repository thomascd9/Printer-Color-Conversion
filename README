pcc: Printer Color Conversion

By Thomas Chang-Davidson

Converts image file from color to greyscale equivalent in blue, green,
red, or purple and then prints it out with lp

usage: pcc file_to_print.pdf -c {r, g, b, p} -d
	-c for choice of color, blue is default
	-d for double sided

Helpful: add this to ~/.bash_profile to make a shortcut for it
	alias pcc="~/Programming/Python/pcc/pcc.bash"

Things to change if stuff gets moved/ "settings":
	in pcc.py, check sys.path against what it is where you're running it
	in pcc.py, add more colors in get_black function
	in pcc.bash, $printer to set printer. See list of printers with lpstat
	in pcc.bash, $pyfile if the python file pcc.py gets moved
	in pcc.bash, $tempname if your stuff is getting deleted accidentally

To do:
	allow for -d and -c options to be in any order (has to be -c first now)

How it works
1. pcc.py
	This is the python file that does the color conversion using
	pdf2image and Python Image Library

2. pcc.bash
	This is the bash script that runs the color conversion
